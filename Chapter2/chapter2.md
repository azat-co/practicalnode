# Using Express.js 4 to Create Node.js Web Apps

It’s only logical that, by using frameworks, software engineers become more productive and can achieve results faster. Often, the results are of a better quality because the frameworks are used and maintained by many other developers and contributors. Even if developers build everything from scratch, they end up with *their own framework* in the end. It&#39;s just a very customized one!

Node.js is a relatively young platform when it comes to frameworks (unlike Ruby or Java), but there&#39;s already a leader that has become a de facto standard used in the majority of Node.js projects: Express.js.

Express.js is an amazing framework for Node.js projects, and it&#39;s used in the majority of web apps, which is why this second chapter is dedicated to getting started with this framework.

In this chapter we cover the following topics, which serve as an introduction to Express.js:

- What Express.js is

- How Express.js works

- Express.js Installation

- Express.js scaffolding (command-line tool)

- The Blog Project overview

- Express.js 4 Hello World example

# What Is Express.js?

Express.js is a web framework based on the core Node.js `http` module and [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)(<http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/>) components. The components are called *middleware* and they are the cornerstones of the framework philosophy *configuration over convention*. In other words, Express.js systems are highly configurable, which allows developers to pick freely whatever libraries they need for a particular project. For these reasons, the Express.js framework leads to flexibility and high customization in the development of web applications.

If you write serious apps using only core Node.js modules (refer to the following snippet for an example), you most likely find yourself reinventing the wheel by writing the same code continually for similar tasks, such as the following:

- Parsing of HTTP request bodies

- Parsing of cookies

- Managing sessions

- Organizing routes with a chain of `if` conditions based on URL paths and HTTP methods of the requests

- Determining proper response headers based on data types

To illustrate my point, here is an example of a two-route representational state transfer(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>).

 (REST) API server, i.e., we have only two end points and they are also called *routes*. In this application, we use only core Node.js modules for server functions. A single &quot;userland&quot;/external native MongoDB driver module is used for persistence. This example is taken from beginner-friendly [Rapid Prototyping with JS](http://rpjs.co/)(<http://rpjs.co/>): Agile JavaScript Development by Azat Mardan [2013]:

    var http = require('http');
    var util = require('util');
    var querystring = require('querystring');
    var mongo = require('mongodb');

    var host = process.env.MONGOHQ_URL ||
      'mongodb://@127.0.0.1:27017';
    //MONGOHQ_URL=mongodb://user:pass@server.mongohq.com/db_name
    mongo.Db.connect(host, function(error, client) {
      if (error) throw error;
      var collection = new mongo.Collection(
         client,
        'test_collection'
      );
      var app = http.createServer(
        function (request, response) {
          if (
            request.method === 'GET' &&
            request.url === '/messages/list.json'
          ) {
            collection.find().toArray(function(error, results) {
              response.writeHead(
                200,
                {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'}
              );
              console.dir(results);
            response.end(JSON.stringify(results));
          });
        };
        if (
          request.method === "POST" &&
          request.url === "/messages/create.json"
        ) {
          request.on('data', function(data) {
            collection.insert(
              querystring.parse(data.toString('utf-8')),
              {safe: true},
              function(error, obj) {
                if (error) throw error;
                response.end(JSON.stringify(obj));
              }
            );
          });
        };
      });
      var port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
      app.listen(port);
    })
As you can see, developers have to do a lot of manual work themselves, such as interpreting HTTP methods and URLs into routes, and parsing input and output data.

Express.js solves these and many other problems as abstraction and code organization. The framework provides a model-view-controller-like (MVC-like) structure for your web apps with a clear separation of concerns (views, routes, models).

For the models (M in MVC), we need to use [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)(<http://mongoosejs.com/>) or [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com/)(<http://sequelizejs.com/>) libraries in *addition* to Express.js— more on this later in the book in Chapter 7. In this chapter we&#39;ll cover the basics of Express.js. Built on top this framework, Express.js applications can vary from bare-bones, back-end-only REST APIs to full-blown, highly scalable, full-stack (with [jade-browser](https://npmjs.org/package/jade-browser)(<https://npmjs.org/package/jade-browser>) and [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/)(<http://socket.io/>)) real-time web apps. To give some analogies to developers who are familiar with Ruby—Express.js is often seen as Sinatra, which has a very different approach to the Ruby on Rails framework. Express.js and Sinatra promote the configurability while Ruby on Rails *convention over configuration*.

Although Express.js is the most starred library on NPM (as of May 2014), and the most mature and used Node.js framework, the playing field is still relatively level with many different frameworks, and new ones are released every month. Some of them, such as [Meteor](http://meteor.com/)(<http://meteor.com/>) and [DerbyJS](http://derbyjs.com/)(<http://derbyjs.com/>), show an interesting trend in attempts to merge front-end and back-end code bases. For a handpicked list of Node.js frameworks, refer to the [Node Framework](http://nodeframework.com/)(<http://nodeframework.com/>) resource.

When evaluating a Node.js framework for your project, use these easy steps to guide you:

- Build a sample app, which is usually provided by the creators of frameworks on GitHub or official web sites. See how the app feels in terms of styles and patterns.

- Consider the type of application you&#39;re building: prototype, production app, minimum viable product (MVP), small scale, large scale, and so on.

- Consider the libraries already familiar to you and determine whether you can or plan to reuse them, and whether your framework plays nicely with them. Provide out-of-the-box solutions: template engines, database object-relational mapping(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping>) libraries (ORMs) / drivers, cascading style sheets(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets>) (CSS) frameworks.

- Consider the nature of your application: REST API (with a separate front-end client), a traditional web app, or a traditional web app with REST API end points (such as Blog).

- Consider whether you need the support of reactive templates with WebSocket from the get-go (the Meteor, anyone?).

- Evaluate the number of stars and follows on NPM and GitHub to judge the popularity of the framework. More popular typically means more blog posts, books, screencasts, tutorials, and programmers exist; less popular means this is a newer framework, a niche/custom choice, or a poor choice. With newer frameworks, there is a greater chance that contributing back to them will be valued, so pick your comfortable spot.

- Evaluate NPM, GitHub pages, and a framework&#39;s website for the presence of good API documentation with examples or open issues/bugs. If there are more than a few hundred, depending on popularity, this may not be a good sign. Also, determine the date of the last commit on the GitHub repository. Anything older than six months is not a good sign.

# How Express.js Works

Express.js usually has an entry point—aka, a main file. Most of the time, this is the file that we start with the node command; or export as a module, in some cases. And in this file, we do the following:

1. Include third-party dependencies as well as our own modules, such as controllers, utilities, helpers, and models

2. Configure Express.js app settings such as template engine and its file extensions

3. Connect to databases such as MongoDB, Redis, or MySQL (optional)

4. Define middleware such as error handlers, static files folder, cookies, and other parsers

5. Define routes

6. Start the app

7. Export the app as a module (optional)

When the Express.js app is running, it&#39;s listening to requests. Each incoming request is processed according to a defined chain of middleware and routes, starting from top to bottom. This aspect is important in controlling the execution flow. For example, routes/middleware that are higher in the file have precedence over the lower definitions.

Because we can have multiple middleware functions processing each HTTP request, some of the functions are in the middle (hence the name *middleware*). Here are some examples of middleware purposes:

1. Parse cookie information and put it in `req` object for following middleware/routes

2. Parse parameters from the URL and put it in `req` object for following middleware/routes

3. Get the information from the database based on the value of the parameter if the user is authorized (cookie/session) and put it in `req` object for following middleware/routes

4. Authorize users/requests (,or not)

5. Display the data and end the response

# Express.js Installation

The Express.js package comes in two flavors:

1. `express-generator`: a global NPM package that provides the command-line tool for rapid app creation (scaffolding)

2. `express`: a local package module in your Node.js app&#39;s `node_modules` folder

## Express.js Version

Before we proceed with installations, let&#39;s check the Express.js versions. We&#39;ll use an exact version 4.1.2 to avoid confusion resulting from potential future changes to the Express.js skeleton-generating mechanism and the module API.

For the Express.js Generator, which is a separate module, we&#39;ll use version 4.0.0, which is compatible with Express.js 4.x. If you have a version other than 4.0.0 (`$ express -V` to check), you can uninstall it using `$ sudo npm uninstall -g express-generator`. Or `$ sudo npm uninstall -g express` for Express.js 2.x and 3.x. Before, version 4.x, Express.js Generator was a part of the Express.js module itself. After you&#39;ve uninstalled the older versions, install the proper version with the next section&#39;s commands.

## Express.js Generator

To install the Express.js Generator as global package, run `$ npm install -g express-generator@4.0.0` from anywhere on your computer. This downloads and links the `$ express` terminal command to the proper path, so that later we can access its command-line interface (CLI) for the creation of new apps.

**Note**: For Max OS X and Linux users, if there is an error installing globally, most likely your system requires root/administrator rights to write to the folder. In this case, `$ sudo npm install -g express-generator@4.0.0` might be needed. Refer to Chapter 1 for more information on changing NPM ownership.

Of course, we can be more vague and tell NPM to install the latest version of `express-generator`: `$ npm install –g express-generator`. But in this case your results might be inconsistent with the book&#39;s examples.

The Figure 2-1 shows us results of running the aforementioned command. Please notice the path in Figure 2-1: `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/express-generator`. This is where, on Max OS X / Linux systems, NPM puts global modules by default. We verify the availability of Express.js CLI by running `$ express –V`.

![alt](media/Image1.png)

***Figure 2-1.** The result of running NPM with `-g` and `$ express -V`*

## Local Express.js

For the local Express.js 4.1.2 module installation, let&#39;s create a new folder `express-cli` somewhere on your computer: `$ mkdir express-cli`. This will be our project folder for the chapter. Now we can open it with `$ cd express-cli`. When we are inside the project folder, we can create `package.json` manually in a text editor or with the `$ npm init` terminal command (Figure 2-2).

![alt](media/Image2.png)

***Figure 2-2.** The result of running `$ npm init`*

The following is an example of the `package.json` file with vanilla `$ npm init` options:

    {
      "name": "express-cli",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "description": "",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
      },
      "author": "",
      "license": "BSD"
    }

Lastly, we install the module using NPM:

    $ npm install express@4.1.2 --save

Or, if we want to be less specific, which is not recommended for this example, use:

    $ npm install express

**Note**: If you attempt to run the aforementioned `$ npm install express` command without the `package.json` file or the `node_modules` folder, the *smart* NPM will traverse up the directory tree to the folder that has either of these two things. This behavior mimics Git&#39;s logic somewhat. For more information on the NPM installation algorithm, please refer to [the official documentation](https://npmjs.org/doc/folders.html)(<https://npmjs.org/doc/folders.html>).

Alternatively, we can update the `package.json` file by specifying the dependency `("express": "4.1.2"` or `"express": "4.x")` and run `$ npm install`.

The following is the `package.json` file with an added Express.js v4.1.2 dependency (the latest as of May 2014):

    {
      "name": "expressjsguide",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "description": "",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "express": "4.1.2"
      },
      "author": "",
      "license": "BSD"
    }
    $ npm install

In the Figure 2-3, we show the result of install Express.js v4.1.2 locally, into the `node_modules` folder. Please notice the path after the `express@4.1.2` string in Figure 2-3 this time it&#39;s local and not global, as in the case of `express-generator`.

![alt](media/Image3.png)

***Figure 2-3.** The result of running $ npm install*

If you want to install Express.js to an existing project and save the dependency (smart thing to do!) into the `package.json` file, which is already present in that project&#39;s folder, run `$ npm install express@4.1.2 --save`.

To double-check the installation of Express.js and its dependencies, we can run the `$ npm ls` command, as shown in Figure 2-4.

# Express.js Scaffolding

So far, we&#39;ve covered Express.js installation. When it comes to prototyping, it&#39;s vital to be able to get started quickly with the solid app skeleton, which is why many modern frameworks provide some type of scaffolding. Now is the time to explore its rapid app creation mechanism— Express.js Generator!

Comparable with Ruby on Rails and many other web frameworks, Express.js comes with a CLI for jump-starting your development process. The CLI generates a basic foundation for the most common cases.

If you followed the global installation instructions in the installation section, you should be able to see the version number 4.0.0 if you run `$ express -V` from anywhere on your machine. If we type `$ express -h` or `$ express --help`, we should get the list of available options and their usage. The list of options is broken down below to serve readers as a reference.

To generate a skeleton Express.js app, we need to run a terminal command— `express [options] [dir|appname]`—the options for which are the following:

- `-e`, `--ejs`: add [EJS](http://embeddedjs.com/)(<http://embeddedjs.com/>) engine support (by default, [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/tutorial/)(<http://jade-lang.com/tutorial/>) is used)
- `-H`, `--hogan`: add Hogan.js engine support
- `-c <engine>`, `--css <engine>`: add stylesheet `<engine>` support, such as [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)(<http://lesscss.org/>), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)(<http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/>) or Compass(<http://compass-style.org/>) (by default, plain CSS is used)

- `-f`, `--force`: force app generation on a nonempty directory

If the dir/appname option is omitted, Express.js creates files using the current folder as the base for the project. Otherwise, the application is in the folder with the name provided.

Now that we&#39;re clear with the command and its options, let&#39;s go step by step to create an app with the scaffolding:

1. Check the Express.js version, because the app-generating code is prone to changes.

2. Execute the scaffolding command with options.

3. Run the application locally.

4. Understand the different sections, such as routes, middleware, and configuration.

5. Peek into the Jade template (more on this in Chapter 3).

## Express.js Command-Line Interface

Now we can use the CLI to spawn new Express.js apps. For example, to create an app with Stylus support, type the following:

    $ express -c styl express-styl

Then, as the instructions in the terminal tell us (Figure 2-5), type:

    $ cd express-styl && npm install
    $ DEBUG=my-application ./bin/www

Open the browser of your choice at <http://localhost:3000>.

![alt](media/Image5.png)

***Figure 2-5.** The result of using Express.js Generator*

If you don&#39;t have computer in front of your right now, here&#39;s the full code of `express-styl/app.js` using Express.js Generator v4.0.0:

    var express = require('express');
    var path = require('path');
    var favicon = require('static-favicon');
    var logger = require('morgan');
    var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
    var bodyParser = require('body-parser');

    var routes = require('./routes/index');
    var users = require('./routes/users');

    var app = express();

    // view engine setup
    app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
    app.set('view engine', 'jade');

    app.use(favicon());
    app.use(logger('dev'));
    app.use(bodyParser.json());
    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded());
    app.use(cookieParser());
    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

    app.use('/', routes);
    app.use('/users', users);

    /// catch 404 and forwarding to error handler
    app.use(function(req, res, next) {
        var err = new Error('Not Found');
        err.status = 404;
        next(err);
    });

    /// error handlers

    // development error handler
    // will print stacktrace
    if (app.get('env') === 'development') {
        app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
            res.status(err.status || 500);
            res.render('error', {
                message: err.message,
                error: err
            });
        });
    }

    // production error handler
    // no stacktraces leaked to user
    app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
        res.status(err.status || 500);
        res.render('error', {
            message: err.message,
            error: {}
        });
    });

    module.exports = app;

## Routes in Express.js

When you open `express-styl/app.js`, you see two routes in the middle:

    app.use('/', routes);
    app.use('/users', users);

The first one basically takes care of all the requests to the home page, such as `http://localhost:3000/`. The second takes care of requests to `/users`, such as `http://localhost:3000/users`. Both of the routes process URLs in a case-insensitive manner and in a same way as with trailing slashes.

By default, Express.js doesn&#39;t allow developers to route by query string arguments, such as the following:

    GET: www.webapplog.com/?id=10233
    GET: www.webapplog.com/about/?author=10239
    GET: www.webapplog.com/books/?id=10&ref=201

However, it&#39;s trivial to write your own middleware. It might look like this:

    app.use(function (req, res, next) {
      if (req.query.id) {
        // process the id, then call next() when done
      else if (req.query.author) {
        // same approach as with id
      else if (req.query.id && req.query.ref) {
        // process when id and ref present
      } else {
        next();
      }
    });

    app.get('/about', function (req, res, next) {
        // this code is executed after the query string middleware
    });

The request handler itself (`index.js`, in this case) is straightforward. Everything from the HTTP request is in `req` and it writes results to the response in `res`:

    exports.list = function(req, res){
      res.send('respond with a resource');
    };

## Middleware as the Backbone of Express.js

Each line/statement above the routes in `app.js` is middleware:

    var favicon = require('static-favicon');
    var logger = require('morgan');
    var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
    var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
    //...
    app.use(favicon());
    app.use(logger('dev'));
    app.use(bodyParser.json());
    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded());
    app.use(cookieParser());
    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

The middleware includes pass-through functions that either do something useful or add something helpful to the request as it travels along each of them. For example, `bodyParser()` and `cookieParser()` add HTTP request payload (`req.body`) and parsed cookie data (`req.cookie`), respectively. And in our `app.js`, `app.use(logger('dev'));` is tirelessly printing in the terminal pretty logs for each request. In Express.js 3.x many, of these middleware were part of the Express.js module, but not in version 4.x. For this reason the generator declared and included, and we installed additional modules like `static-favicon`, `morgan`, `cookie-parser` and `body-parser`.

## Configuration of an Express.js App

Here is how we define configuration statements in a typical Express.js app (the `app.js` file):

    app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
    app.set('view engine', 'jade');

And in bin/www:

    app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000);

An ordinary setting involves a name, such as `views`, and a value, such as `path.join(__dirname, 'views')`, the path to the folder where a templates/views live.

Sometimes there is more than one way to define a certain setting. For example, `app.enable('trust proxy')` for Boolean flags is identical (aka, sugar-coating) to `app.set('trust proxy', true)`. The Chapter 11 explains why we might need to trust proxy.

## Jade Is Haml for Express.js/Node.js

The Jade template engine is akin to the Ruby on Rails’ Haml in the way it uses whitespace and indentation, such as `layout.jade`:

    doctype html
    html
      head
        title= title
        link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/style.css')
      body
        block content

Other than that, it&#39;s possible to use a full-blown JavaScript code inside of Jade templates with the `-` prefix. More information on Jade and Handlebars template engines is in Chapter 4.

## Conclusion About Scaffolding

As you&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s effortless to create web apps with Express.js. The framework is splendid for REST APIs as well. If you feel like the settings and other methods mentioned in this chapter just flew over your head, don&#39;t despair! Pro Express.js 4 [2014 Apress] is dedicated solely to the Express.js, and its interface and can server as a good reference. For now, the next step is to create a foundation for our project: the Blog app.

# The Blog Project Overview

Our Blog app consists of five main parts from the user perspective:

- A home page with a list of articles (Figure 2-6)

- An individual article page with the full-text article

- An admin page for publishing and removing content

- A login page for accessing the aforementioned admin page

- A post article page for adding new content

![alt](media/Image6.png)

***Figure 2-6.** The home page of the Blog app*

From a developer&#39;s point of view, the app has the following elements:

- *Main file* `app.js`: settings, inclusions of routes, and other important logic. This is where we run when we start the server.
- *Routes*: all the logic related to pages and abstracted from `app.js` based on functional meaning, such as getting the data from the database and compiling the data into HTML
- *Node.js project file* `package.json`: dependencies and other meta data
- *Dependencies in* `node_modules`: third-party modules installed via `package.json`
- *Database*: an instance of MongoDB and some seed data
- *Templates*: the `*.jade` files
- *Static files*: such as `*.css` or browser `*.js`
- *Configuration file* `config.json`: security-insensitive applicationwide settings, such as app title

Although somewhat primitive, this application contains all the CRUD(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete>) (create, read, update, and delete) elements of modern web development. In addition, we use two approaches in Blog when sending the data to the server:

1. Submit data via traditional forms *with* full page refresh

2. Submit data via REST API (AJAX HTTP requests) *without* page refresh

The source code for this mini-project is under `ch2/hello-world` folder of practicalnode GitHub repository: https://github.com/azat-co/practicalnode.

## Submitting the Data

The first approach is traditional and is considered more search engine optimization friendly, but it takes longer for users (especially on mobile) and is not as smooth as the second approach (Figure 2-7).

***Figure 2-7.** Traditional server-side approach*

Sending and receiving data via REST API/HTTP requests and rendering HTML on the client side is used with front-end frameworks such as Backbone.js, Angular, Ember, and [many others](http://todomvc.com/)(<http://todomvc.com/>) (Figure 2-8). The use of these frameworks is becoming more and more common nowadays because it allows for more efficiency (HTML is rendered on the client side and only the data are transmitted) and better code organization.

***Figure 2-8.** REST API approach diagram*

Under the hood, virtually all front-end frameworks use jQuery&#39;s `ajax()` method. So, to give you a realistic example, the admin page uses REST API end points via jQuery `$.ajax()` calls to manipulate the articles, including publish, unpublish, and remove (Figure 2-9).

Unlike the previous section of this chapter, which dealt with scaffolding with CLI, in this practical exercise we intentionally wanted to show how to create an Express.js app manually, because it gives us a better understanding of how things really work together in the framework.

Let&#39;s wait no more, and start by creating our project folders.

# Express.js 4 Hello World Example

This is the first and the last hello world example in this book! :-) The goal is to show readers how easy is it to create Express.js apps from scratch without generators, fancy modules and middleware. We&#39;ll go through these sections:

- Setting up folders

- NPM init and package.json

- Dependency declaration

- The app.js file

- Meet Jade

- Running the app

## Setting up Folders

Express.js is very configurable and almost all folders can be renamed. However, there are certain conventions that might help beginners to find their way through many files. Here is a list of the main folders that we use in this chapter, and their meaning:

- `node_modules`: dependencies (third-party modules) live here as well as Express.js and Connect libraries

- `views`: Jade (or any other template engine) files

That&#39;s it for now, but if you want to create a few more folders for other examples (that we&#39;ll cover in the later chapters), be my guest:

- `routes`: Node.js modules that contain request handlers

- `db`: seed data and scripts for MongoDB

- `public`: all the static (front-end) files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript (browser), and Stylus (or any other CSS-language framework files)

Let&#39;s choose a project folder `hello-world`, and create these directories with Finder or the following terminal command (Figure 2-10):

    mkdir {public,public/css,public/img,public/js,db,views,views/includes,routes}

![alt](media/Image10.png)

***Figure 2-10.** Setting up folders*

Now we&#39;re all set to add project metadata with NPM.

## NPM Init and package.json

For this example we will be creating the Express.js app from scratch, i.e., without Express.js Generator. We&#39;ll start with defining dependencies with package.json and NPM.

NPM is used not only as a registry, but also as a dependency management tool. Therefore, it&#39;s essential to set up the project file—`package.json`. Although it&#39;s possible to create the `package.json` file manually in a text editor, we can use the `$ npm init` command. Run this command in your project folder and answer all the questions (or leave them blank):

    $ npm init

After the wizard has finished and the `package.json` file is there (don&#39;t worry if there&#39;s not much information there yet), we can install modules conveniently and add entries to `package.json` at the same time with `$ npm install <package-name> --save`—for example:

    $ npm install express --save

The previous command uses the latest stable version (4.1.2 as of May 2014). We recommend being more specific—which is more robust in the land of the rapidly growing Node.js community—and ask for a specific version:

    $ npm install express@4.1.2 --save

For the Blog app, we need the following modules, which are the latest as of this writing:

- Express.js: 4.1.2

- Jade: 1.3.1

- Mongoskin: 0.6.1

- Stylus: 0.44.0

**Warning**: Feel free to update to newer versions. However, your results might vary, because it&#39;s very common in the Node.js ecosystem (“userland”) to see breaking changes introduced by new versions. This usually happens unintentionally by the dependency of a dependency. For example, even if we include a specific version of Express.js such as 3.4.5, that module includes Jade with a wildcard `*`, and then on Jade&#39;s breaking update, our app will suffer damage. The cure is to commit your `node_modules` folder along with the rest of the source code to a Git repository and use that instead of fetching modules according to `package.json` each time on deployment. Or use NPM&#39;s shrinkwarp feature. Read more about this issue in Chapter 12.

## Dependency Declaration: npm install

Another way to create a `package.json` file (without using `$ npm init`) is to type or copy and paste `package.json` and run `$ npm install`:

    {
      "name": "hello-world",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "private": true,
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node app.js"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "express": "4.1.2",
        "jade": "1.3.1",
        "mongoskin": "1.4.1",
        "stylus": "0.44.0"
      }
    }

In the end, the `node_modules` folder should be filled with the corresponding libraries.

If you noticed, one of the questions `npm init` asked was about the so-called entry point. In our case, it&#39;s the `app.js` file, and it&#39;s the home for most of the application&#39;s logic. To run it, simply use one of the following commands:

- `$ node app.js`
- `$ node app`
- `$ npm start`

Another approach is to name the entry point `index.js`. In this case, we get the benefit of running the script with the `$ node` . command.

Let&#39;s create the first iteration of `app.js`.

## The App.js File

The `app.js` file is the main file for this example. A typical structure of the main Express.js file consists of the following areas (this may be a partial repeat from an earlier section, but this is important, so bear with me):

1. Require dependencies

2. Configure settings

3. Connect to database (*optional*)

4. Define middleware

5. Define routes

6. Start the server

7. Start workers with clusters (a term spawn workers is also used for this)(*optional*)

The order here is important, because requests travel from top to bottom in the chain of middleware.

Let&#39;s perform a quintessential programming exercise: writing the Hello World application. This app transitions smoothly into the Blog example project, so no effort is wasted!

Open `app.js` in a code editor of your choice and start writing (or just copy code from [GitHub](http://github.com/azat-co/blog-express)(<http://github.com/azat-co/blog-express>)).

First, all the dependencies need to be included with `require()`:

    var express = require('express');
    var http = require('http');
    var path = require('path');

Then, the Express.js object is instantiated (Express.js uses a functional pattern):

    var app = express();

One of the ways to configure Express.js settings is to use `app.set()`, with the name of the setting and the value. For example:

`app.set('appName', hello-world');`

Let&#39;s define a few such configurations in `app.js`:

- `port`: a number on which our server should listen to requests
- `views`: absolute path to the folder with template (views in our example)
- `view engine`: file extension for the template files (for example, `jade`, `html`)

If we want to use the port number provided in the environmental variables (env vars), this is how to access it: `process.env.PORT`.

So let&#39;s write the code for the settings we listed earlier:

    app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000);
    app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
    app.set('view engine', 'jade');

Next comes the middleware section of the application. Middleware is the backbone of the Express.js framework and it comes in two flavors:

1. Defined in external (third-party)modules, such as `bodyParser.json` from Connect/Express.js `body-parser`: `app.use(bodyParser.json());`

2. Defined in the app or its modules, such as `app.use(function(req, res, next){...});`

Middleware is a way to organize and reuse code, and, essentially, it is nothing more than a function with three parameters: `request`, `response`, and `next`. We&#39;ll use more middleware (for example, for authorization and for persistence) in Chapter 6, but for now, its use is minimal.

The next components in the `app.js` file are routes. Routes are processed in the order they are defined. Usually, routes are put after middleware, but some middleware may be placed following the routes. A good example of such middleware, found after a routes,, is error handler.

An illustration in Figure 2-11 shows how an HTTP request is processed.

The next section is where we define routes themselves (the order in `app.js` matters). The way routes are defined in Express.js is with helpers `app.VERB(url, fn1, fn2, ..., fn)`, where `fnNs` are request handlers, `url` is on a URL pattern in RegExp, and `VERB` values are as follows:

- `all`: catch every request (all methods)

- `get`: catch GET requests

- `post`: catch POST requests

- `put`: catch PUT requests

- `del`: catch DELETE requests

**Note**: `del` and `delete` methods are aliases, just remember that `delete` is a valid operator in JavaScript/ECMAScript, and therefore in Node.js. The operator removes a property from an object, e.g., `delete books.nodeInAction`.

Figure 2-11 shows how a trivial request might travel across the web and the Express.js app, with the dotted lines being the connection inside it.

![alt](media/Image11.png)

***Figure 2-11.** Following a simple request in an Express.js app*

In this Hello World example, remove a single route is used to catch requests of all methods on all URLs (`*` wildcard):

    app.all('*', function(req, res) {
      ...
    })

Inside the request handler, a template is rendered (`res.render()` function) with a message `msg` (property of the second argument):

    app.all('*', function(req, res) {
        res.render('index', {msg: 'Welcome to the Practical Node.js!'})
    })

The `res.render(viewName, data, callback(error, html))` where parameters mean following:

- `viewName`: a template name with filename extension or if `view engine` is set without the extension is set without the extension
- `data`: an optional object that is passed as `locals`; for example, to use `msg` in Jade, we need to have `{msg: "..."}`
- `callback`: an optional function that is called with an error and HTML when the compilation is complete

`res.render()` is not in the Node.js core and is purely an Express.js addition that, if invoked, calls core `res.end()`, which ends/completes the response. In other words, the middleware chain doesn&#39;t proceed after `res.render()`. `res.render` is highlighted in chapter 4.

Last but not least are the instructions to start the server, which consist of the core `http` module and its `createServer` method. In this method, the system passes the Express.js `app` object with all the settings and routes:

    http.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function(){
      console.log('Express server listening on port ' + app.get('port'));
    });

Here&#39;s the full source code of the `app.js` file for your reference:

    var express = require('express');

    var http = require('http');
    var path = require('path');

    var app = express();

    app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000);
    app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
    app.set('view engine', 'jade');

    app.all('*', function(req, res) {
      res.render(
        'index',
         {msg: 'Welcome to the Practical Node.js!'}
      );
    });

    http
      .createServer(app)
      .listen(
        app.get('port'),
        function(){
          console.log(
           'Express.js server listening on port ' +
            app.get('port')
          );
        }
      );

Before we can run this server, we need to create the `index.jade` file.

## Meet Jade: One Template to Rule Them All

Jade is an absolutely amazing template engine that allows developers to type less code and to execute powerfully almost all JavaScript functions. It also supports top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top inclusion and other useful things. Like its brother from the Ruby world, Haml, Jade uses whitespace/indentation as a part of its language. It&#39;s a convention to use two-space indentation.

The Jade syntax and its features are covered more extensively in Chapter 4. For now, just keep in mind that the way Jade works is that the first word is used as an HTML tag (HTML element) and the text that follows (a.k.a., inner text), is put inside this element. For example,

    h1 hello
    p Welcome to the Practical Node.js!

Produces the following HTML code:

    <h1>hello</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Practical Node.js!</p>

If we want to output a value of a variable (called `locals`), we use `=`. For example:

    p= msg

For this example, create `index.jade` in the `views` folder that outputs a header and a paragraph with the value `msg` variable inside of that paragraph (i.e., inner text):

    h1 hello
    p= msg

There are more advanced examples of Jade included later in this book; but, for now, everything is set for the first demo!

## Running the Hello World App

When we run the `$ node app` command and open browsers at <http://localhost:3000>, we see what appears in Figure 2-12.

![alt](media/Image12.png)

***Figure 2-12.** The Hello World app in action*

Nothing fancy so far, but it&#39;s worth pointing out that it took us just a few lines (the `app.js` file) to write a fully functional HTTP server! In the next chapter, we add more new and exciting pages using Jade instructions.

# Summary

In this chapter we learned what Express.js is and how it works. We also explored different ways to install it and use its scaffolding (command-line tool) to generate apps. We went through the Blog example with a high-level overview (traditional vs. REST API approaches), and proceeded with creating the project file, folders, and the simple Hello World example, which serves as a foundation for the book&#39;s main project: the Blog app. And then lastly, we touched on a few topics such as settings, a typical request process, routes, AJAX versus server side, Jade, templates, and middleware.
